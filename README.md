# Liveblocks schema language

This repo is where the initial version of our schema language has been
developed, before
[it was open-sourced](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/pull/804).

Find it
[in the `schema-lang/` directory](https://github.com/liveblocks/liveblocks/tree/main/schema-lang)
of our main public repo instead.
